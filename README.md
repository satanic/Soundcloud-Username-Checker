# Soundcloud-Username-Checker
Please keep in mind you can no longer claim ~2 char usernames on Soundcloud.

# How to use:
1) Download or clone this repo.
2) Extract the folder "Soundcloud_Checker" from the rar/zip file.
3) Edit the usernames in 'names.txt' to your liking.
4) Double click the .exe file named 'soundcloud_checker.exe'
5) Leave it to-do its thing. The faster your PC + internet, the faster it'll go.

I recommend using this on a RDP as they're usually faster than most computers.

# Features:
Sweet fuck all, it's a basic py-to-exe program that checks the availablility of Soundcloud usernames.

Enjoy & make sure to saturate the market!
